# Contributing

Fork, branch off `main`, make your changes, open a PR.

- `make test` and `make lint` must pass
- Follow the existing code patterns (`pkg/errors`, `pkg/logger`, `pkg/config`)
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`

Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
